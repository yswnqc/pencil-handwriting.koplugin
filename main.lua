Low-latency stylus handwriting for e-ink readers with a Wacom/EMR digitizer
(Kindle Scribe and friends).

Design notes
------------
* Two input sources, tried in this order:

  1. KOReader's own stylus pipeline (`Input:registerStylusCallback`). KOReader
     has already opened the right node, already knows which multitouch slot
     belongs to the pen (BTN_TOOL_PEN / BTN_TOOL_RUBBER bracketing), and --
     crucially -- a callback that returns true makes `routeStylusEvents`
     remove the slot from `self.MTSlots` before the gesture detector runs.
     That is what stops a pen stroke from being read as a page-turn swipe.

  2. Reading the digitizer node directly via evdev, for builds without the
     stylus API. Node selection is capability-driven: a node whose KEY bitmap
     advertises BTN_TOOL_PEN wins.

* Rendering only ever *adds* ink; it never blits a white sheet:

  - while writing, strokes go straight into the live framebuffer, so only the
    pixels the pen actually covers are darkened and the page underneath
    survives;
  - `ReaderView:paintTo` is hooked, so every repaint KOReader performs paints
    the current page's strokes back on top. Notes therefore survive page
    turns, menu visits, rotation and erasing.

  An earlier version kept a full-screen white canvas and blitted it over the
  framebuffer. That covered the page and every open menu (hence the white
  screen), and the notes disappeared as soon as KOReader repainted the page.

* Erasing cannot paint white, for the same reason: it deletes the strokes the
  eraser touched and asks for a repaint.

* Only the pen writes. A skin contact cannot be told from the pen by the event
  data -- KOReader's touch layer writes its contacts into whichever slot is
  current, and that is the pen slot once the pen has been seen -- so the gate is
  the *path* the samples describe: the digitizer tracks the pen and nothing else,
  and a contact on the far side of the page is a jump no pen tip can make between
  two samples. Such a sample is dropped rather than drawn, so a hand landing on
  the page produces no ink at all instead of a line across it (see "Pen-only
  gate" below for the three cases and the one deliberate exception).

* Touch blocking is layered, because a touch zone can match only one gesture
  name (GestureRange compares `ges` with ==):

  - the zones cover what a *resting* hand makes before the pen lands -- tap,
    long press, double tap -- plus zones that only count what still gets
    through, for the diagnostics;
  - everything a hand makes *while* the pen is down (swipe, pan, pinch,
    multiswipe, whatever it is called) is covered instead by switching the
    reader's touch input off for as long as the pen is in contact
    (InputContainer:setIgnoreTouchInput). One call for every gesture type, and
    it is released again as soon as the pen leaves, so fingers keep working.

* All submodules live under the plugin-private `pencilhw/` namespace. Sharing
  KOReader's global package.loaded table with other plugins makes a generic
  name such as `core/store` unsafe: whichever plugin loads first wins, and
  the second one silently receives the wrong module.

-- plugin down, hence the pcall -- the plain gettext function stays as fallback
-- and the menu simply stays English.

-- This has to be told apart from what protects the ink. The ink is protected by
-- knowing which samples came from the pen (see the origin oracle above); what a
-- hand is allowed to do to the interface is a separate question, answered here.
--
-- A touch zone can match only one gesture name -- GestureRange compares `ges`
-- with ==, so a list never matches -- which means one zone per gesture, and a
-- wrist being dragged across the screen (swipe / pan / pinch / multiswipe) had
-- no zone at all. It turned the page in the middle of a stroke. What covers all
-- of them at once is the reader-wide ignore-touch state, which swaps out the
-- input container's gesture handler, so no gesture type gets through whatever it
-- is called.
--
-- Finger input has to survive that, so it is spent on the narrowest window that
-- still makes sense (see touchBlockLevel below). Two safety nets come with it,
-- both KOReader's own: showing a widget restores touch for as long as it is on
-- screen, and the state is reset on resume. The watchdog below covers the third
-- case, a pen whose release never arrives.
--
-- How much touch to take away, if any. There are two levels, and the second one
-- exists only because a finger has to keep working:
--
--   "strict"  -- the menu switch is on: the whole writing session is covered, so
--                the pen merely being around is enough;
--   "contact" -- the default: only while the tip is on the glass, which is the
--                one moment a touch cannot be anything but a hand.
--
-- nil means nothing is being protected: drawing is off, or a dialog is on screen
-- and has to stay usable. The tail is handed back with the level, because the two
-- levels need different ones.
